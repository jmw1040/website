Two thoughts on the wave of "I am so done with this country. I am escaping to Canada." commentary I heard a lot of in 2016 when Donald Trump was first elected: 

1. The demographic of people I heard this from were people who were in very similar situations to myself -- unlikely to be explicitly harmed by the policies on Trump's platform (however chaotic and backwards and founded in violence they are). The people I heard this from largely were not in the vulnerable minority whose safety and well-being are most likely to be harmed by Trump's ideology and political movements. 
2. To be able to pick up your life and move it to a new country (Western, rich, majority white, by the way) presumes a tremendous amount of privilege, which includes a decently high level of financial resources.

I recognize that these claims are dramatic and hypothetical - but still. To me, making this claim in this context seems to miss something big. It reveals a failure to understand the true implications and real suffering faced by vulnerable groups in the United States, and it is a failure to understand our complicity in creating and propogating this harm. 

That isn't to say I don't personally also struggle sometimes with escapist mindsets. I find myself talking more and more about moving to somewhere like Japan or Taiwan, where society has figured out some really important pieces of what the public sphere is and how individuals behave in and contribute to it. But to drop myself in and absorb these benefits is to miss an important point. To leave for greener pastures without a backward glance is to fail to do the work.

A tangential thought: I've been thinking a lot about the fantasy of taking extreme measures to push towards broader social justice. What if we just collectively agreed to sink all our resources now into splitting our financial resources across everyone, to pull the poorest out of their current poverty? Yes, I am all in on this - but even if we accomplished this feat, something is still missing. There's something important in the process of progress. What I'm hearing when I read MLK, Malcolm X, RBG is that sustainable change does rest partially on a strong foundation - which includes pervasive societal radicalization in recognizing the rights of all humans and the overhaul of harmful legal processes and -- I guess, in short, systemic change.
