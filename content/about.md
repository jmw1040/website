Hello! I am Jenny, currently based in San Francisco. 

Interested in economics, reading, meditation and mindfulness practice, baking cakes, frisbee, public transit (and other urban issues), and sometimes writing. 

Here is a place to collect various reading, writing, and other thoughts - an exercise in sharing, collecting, and learning.
