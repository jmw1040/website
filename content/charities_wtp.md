Here's a thought that I've been pondering: In the same way that a company cannot rely on behavioral quirks or inattention to drive long-term profits, sustainable, significant redistribution of income must rely on the understanding that a more equitable society is fundamental and necessary to human flourishing. I've been thinking of this through the lens of increasing people's "willingness to pay" for equity - which I believe is broad enough to encompass a lot of avenues for change. For example, it should include direct monetary investments to charities/non-profits, time/energy investments through volunteer work or public service, but also more indirect institutional investments through political acts.
