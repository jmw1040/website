It's true that unemployment is skyrocketing. The painful anecdotes behind the terrifying numbers are somber reminders of how an economy operating at half-capacity disproportionately burdens our most vulnerable populations. However, the debate around COVID-19 public health and financial policies has stagnated in the face of a false dichotomy - succinctly characterized by the trending phrase - "GDP or Grandma". 

Many have voiced their opposition to this facetious "debate" (links below to some I've come across). But I take issue with something even more seemingly innocuous: I disagree with the barrage of NYT headlines and amateur thinkpieces that posit about the current economic landscape in the context of previous economic recessions. 

To be clear, I believe it is valid and legitimate to think carefully about the trade-offs that arise from any policy, and it is particularly important to think carefully when said policies are being rushed through legislation and deliberation in light of a legitimately urgent situation. 

But I do think putting this in context of previous business cycle events is missing the root cause of the problem and encourages "solutions" that ultimately miss the mark (multi-trillion-dollar "stimulus" packages). Unemployment is not rising because small businesses are failing. Unemployment is rising because small businesses are failing *because* we are in the midst of a global pandemic.

As a general rule, it is useful to understand statistics in context of other statistics. In this case, the situation is dire and we (the United States) need to unify and rally our efforts around containing the virus and protecting our vulnerable in the meanwhile. 

Any policy that fails to recognize the severity and urgency of the situation at hand will ultimately fail in maximizing our capacity to help those who are suffering. We have to re-orient, re-organize, and focus our efforts on protecting healthcare workers, caring for the ill, and providing material aid to those whose livelihoods are put on hold precisely in order to achieve the first two ends. 

I have so many caveats left unsaid (maybe will edit them back in later), so a lot of the above is probably unfair at face valuee... and I recognize that this ends up as yet another amateur thinkpiece on COVID-19... Maybe more to come later.

Stuff I've been reading (AKA context for my opinions):

1. [Neale Mahoney's brief](https://review.chicagobooth.edu/economics/2020/article/don-t-fall-false-trade-offs-covid-19-policy) on the false dichotomy at the core of recent debate is quick, to-the-point, and captures most of what I believe needs to be said around this issue

2. [G Elliot Morris's reaction](https://thecrosstab.substack.com/p/this-is-a-full-blown-recession-if) to unemployment rates is one example of many that falls into this temptation to contextualize this with previous recessions in the U.S. (and unluckily happened  to be the last straw for me after a whole month of similarly themed thinkpieces)

3. Paul Krugman's Twitter
