Another set of scattered thoughts that I've had related to recent events and public discussion: what does it take to listen to another person or voice? What work do I need to do - before and during the interaction - to truly hear what someone else is trying to say? What resistance am I harboring that prevents me from doing so? 

Increasingly, I am convinced that listening is first order important in the healing process for this country. Listening is not an absence of action or complicit silence - it is a meaningful, sustainable, important action to be called to. But how do we do it constructively, so that it does lead to tangible change? How do we make sure we're hearing a broad enough range of voices?

I am wondering how minds are changed. It feels like something has shifted in the past week beyond the protests sparked by the death of George Floyd - I am seeing the issue brought to light by people with platforms outside of politics: executives in a for-profit company, an Instagram-famous Food Network star, the head of sports and culture media group. While I can't be sure of broader trends outside my immediate exposure to content, it seems to me like some wall between "political" and "non-political" life is starting to crumble. Concerns of virtue signalling aside, more people are speaking up, and they are saying more. But does this mean people are listening to each other more? I feel wary (but maybe hopeful) on this point.

I am wondering how change is enacted. I've been pondering out loud for the past few months about what Trump supporters believe and look like. I honestly never gave this question much thought before now; assumptions and generalizations about "other" sufficed up to now. But to write off so much of the American population with the broad dismissal (that I see echoed on social media or liberal news outlets) is to miss something really fundamental, I think. These assumptions about "other" are shortcuts that arise when we don't listen. And these shortcuts have - and will continue to - prove harmful to everyone. I don't have any concrete thoughts yet about how to develop some degree of mutual trust and empathy. I am starting to believe that that's the only way to move forward with sustained, long-term, positive change.
