I have been very off-balance lately. I think I know at this point that I shouldn't point to external factors in how "in equilibrium" I am day to day, but it's been hard to avoid this during quarantine. External factors will always exist. In Baton Rouge, it was the orange walls of my childhood bedroom and ridiculous sense that I didn't have the independence to get myself a cup of coffee when I wanted a treat. In New York, it was the heat and the need to cook and the dusty apartment. Now, in Berkeley, it's the smoky outside and the stress of trying to hyper-optimize our living situation in the coming few months. Underlying all of this is a sense of deep insecurity about my lagging pace at work and the impending Fall application cycle. 

A messy attempt to parse the above, in no particular order:

1. Negative narratives abound. Persistent, persistent claims about my worth, my intelligence, my will, my ability to follow through, my comparability to those around me, my ability to focus, my annoyingness to my coworkers, my ability to be present and interesting and alive, my ability to be alone, my ability to be with others, my interest in research, my role on these academic papers. 
2. Habits. I keep saying that I want to meditate, but it is hard to get started. This makes it even harder to start, I think. 
3. Looking back, I always cringe at how dire I make everything out to be. Whatever I'm going through currently is always so dramatic and hard - but my life is very privileged and peaceful!
4. With respect to housing decisions, I can't believe I am getting caught in stress around financial optimization. I am insanely overcompensated and basically will never go without because I make a few silly decisions here or there. 
5. Would like to be more involved in the community. What does it take to feel committed, invested in, reesponsible to, and rooted in a place? I liked what Jenny Odell had to say about this in How to Do Nothing - part of it is a responsibility to be informed about and observant of the wildlife and ecosystem wherever we are. Part of it is refusing to have social media and other problematic actors in the attention economy mediate and determine our relationships with our surrounding communities/neighborhoods. 
6. Should keep a place of affirmations and reflections for me to go back on when I feel uncentered (like advice from E Stone!)
